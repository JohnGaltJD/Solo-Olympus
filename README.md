## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the index.html file in a modern web browser
3. For deployment, see the provided `deploy.ps1` script or refer to the `HOSTING.md` file

## Firebase Setup for Multi-Device Support

For families to access their data across multiple devices:

1. **Create a Firebase Project**
   ```
   1. Go to firebase.google.com and create a new project
   2. Add a web app to your project
   3. Copy the Firebase configuration 
   ```

2. **Update Firebase Configuration**
   ```
   1. Open js/firebase-config.js
   2. Replace the placeholder values with your Firebase config
   ```

3. **Create a Family Code**
   ```
   1. Choose a unique family code (e.g., "smith-family-2023")
   2. Enter this code on the login screen
   3. Share this code with family members
   ```

4. **Test Multi-Device Access**
   ```
   1. Access the app from different devices
   2. Enter the same family code on each device
   3. Verify that changes on one device appear on others
   ```

For detailed setup instructions, see `HOSTING.md`.

## Windows Development Best Practices
- Use the included PowerShell deployment script for local development
- Ensure Python is installed for the built-in HTTP server
- Test in multiple browsers for compatibility

## Multi-Device Hosting Options
- **Home Network Hosting**: Set up a home server to access the app on your local network
- **GitHub Pages**: Host the app on GitHub Pages for free access from any device
- **Cloud Hosting**: Deploy to a cloud provider like Netlify, Vercel or Azure Static Web Apps

## Technology Stack
- **HTML5**: Structure and content
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core functionality and interactivity
- **Firebase Firestore**: Cloud data storage and synchronization
- **Firebase Auth**: Family identification via codes
- **Web Storage API**: Data persistence fallback using localStorage
- **Service Worker API**: For performance enhancements
- **Web App Manifest**: For installable PWA capabilities
- **ARIA**: For accessibility and screen reader support

## Security Considerations
- Data is stored locally on the device
- No sensitive information is transmitted to remote servers
- Parent section secured with a simple password
- Educational tool not designed for real financial transactions

## Testing Plan

A comprehensive testing plan has been developed to ensure the application functions correctly across browsers and devices. The testing plan includes:

- **Browser Compatibility**: Tests across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- **Device Testing**: Desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes
- **Functional Testing**: Core features, transactions, chores, and goals
- **Error Handling**: Automated and manual testing of recovery mechanisms
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing
- **Performance**: Loading times and resource usage metrics

See `testing-plan.md` for the complete testing checklist.

## User Guide

A family-friendly quick start guide has been created to help parents and children understand how to use the application. The guide includes:

- **Parent Instructions**: How to manage accounts, approve transactions, and create chores
- **Child Instructions**: How to complete chores, request money, and set savings goals
- **Tips for Success**: Best practices for both parents and children

See `quick-start-guide.md` for the complete user guide.
